#Annotation Guidelines for Conversational Actions

##Coding system for conversational actions

Specific actions have different functions in conversation. Some actions expect an answer and not answering might break social expectations or norms (Schegloff, 2007). Also, some actions (e.g. accusations and challenges) are more face-threatening than other actions (Brown and Levinson, 1987). Actions represent what the main functions of a post are within the conversation, i.e. what it does and how it relates to other actions taken in previous posts.

A forum post may contain several actions that initiate a social action or respond to another person’s comment (Stommel and Koole, 2010). Sometimes actions might be complementary, or subclasses of another class. For instance, a question might be a challenging question e.g.
“Why are you telling us things that have not been scientifically proven??”.

Sometimes comments might be very long, and often require more than one action label:
“This does not mean that micro-particles of plastic contaminating our air and water are not contributing to some particular types of cancer, or to other illnesses. It's possible and needs further study. And of course there are other reasons to invest in reducing pollution. But there is no evidence to cause alarm about cancer rates. The possibility of a nuclear explosion anywhere in the world, and the resulting radioactive contamination, is a much greater worry.  For a detailed analysis of past trends and projections for cancer incidence in the UK you can read 'Cancer incidence and mortality projections in the UK until 2035' https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5117795/" → “statement”, “rejection”, “challenge”



##Action descriptions

###Question

A question requests information, and makes relevant an answer which either provides or confirms the information, or expresses inability or unwillingness to do so (Couper-Kuhlen & Selting, 2018: 217–248.). Questions can be of several types: yes-no-question (syntactic markings of a yes-no-question: subject-inversion or sentence-final tags), or declarative questions. Declarative questions are utterances that function pragmatically as questions but do not have “question form.” By this we mean that declarative questions normally have no wh-word as the argument of the verb (except in “echo-question” format), and have “declarative” word order in which the subject precedes the verb (see Stolcke et al., 2000). Question form alone is not sufficient (e.g. rhetorical questions that don’t really want to get information), but the pragmatic function of the example should be to ask for information. We examine if the example expects information or an answer; if not it is very likely not a question (“why are you taking time to post a reddit comment? get back to work, lazy, entitled, slacking snowflake”). Example utterances:
Do you have to have any special training? 
But that doesn’t eliminate it, does it? 
Uh, I guess a year ago you were probably watching C N N a lot, right? 
So you’re taking a government course? 

###Request/proposal

A request is used to proffer a service for the speaker (Couper-Kuhlen, 2014; Clayman, 2014), expecting an acceptance or rejection (Couper-Kuhlen, 2014: 259–266). We consider them similar to proposals, as both are directives. Commands are also included in this category. These can often be recognized from imperative verb form (e.g. “go away, “ give me the bottle”). Examples:
“Can you give me the salt please.”
“Tell me how to find the HR office.”
“Please go to Kitaooji station by subway.”

Proposals, instead of directly requesting for some other person to act, offer a more indirect suggestion. These are more often more polite than requests, being indirect. The main idea is that proposals do not contain direct imperative forms, but e.g. offer a suggestion on how a person or a group could/should act. These can be directed at an interlocutor, but also an actor outside of the discussion. Examples: 
“Maybe you could try drinking more tea instead of coffee.”
“The government should buy more masks for the public.”
Note that indirect directives can also have the main agenda of being requests or proposals, e.g. “Why don’t you go first”. This has the word “why” which is usually found in questions, but is really a proposal more than a question. 

###Accusation

Accusations represent a moral conflict: they convey a negative stance or complaint, ascribing the responsibility for an unsatisfactory event to a person or a group, thus demanding for accountability (Turowetz & Maynard, 2010). The accused is expected to deny or contest the accusation (Pomerantz, 1978; Atkinson & Drew, 1979), acknowledge it and explain themselves (Dersley & Wootton, 2000) or perhaps apologize. For example, an accusation can express a complaint about something another person did wrong, something that goes against generally accepted social rules. So, accusations often describe some action taken by another person, something that is commonly considered to be wrong or impolite, and then they assign blame for this action to another person or group. Caen also encase very direct explicit forms like “you lied”/”You are trolling.” Examples:
“You just called Helen an idiot, basically, that’s what you implied. That’s so impolite.”
“You are obviously trolling, and not even seriously taking part in the discussion.”
“You are being extremely petty.”

###Epistemic challenge

Challenges represent an epistemic conflict. They convey a negative stance towards another party (individual or group), denying the epistemic knowledge basis of the interlocutor's priorly expressed claims, actions, or feelings, through various forms (e.g. assertive/interrogative; Koshik, 2003). Examples:
“That’s a completely ridiculous claim and, may I add, you are totally incorrect.”
“You shouldn’t be in this discussion group, if you don’t even like cats.”
“Seems like you can’t prove your claims.” 

In our definition, a challenge should include explicit linguistic cues that create a clear (provocative) juxtaposition between two objects, or actors (for example, “you are wrong”). Cues include e.g.: valenced (negatively) strong counter positioning through words e.g. “There are severe problems to…”, “Well, it’s actually widely known that (instead of)…”, “It is troublesome that you state that…”. Similes or metaphors that create polarized/provokative juxtapositions are essentially characteristics of challenges: e.g. “That’s like saying grass is greener on the other side…”. Directness is characteristic of challenges in many cases, but they can be expressed indirectly as well.

To discern between denial and challenge: challenges can function independently in the conversation without acting as responses to other pair initiating actions. However, denials are always part of an action pair, responding to an initiating action (request, accusation, challenge). In contrast to accusations, challenges orient towards knowledge, refusing or challenging it, or to challenging a participants epistemic authority on the matter, whereas accusations attribute socially problematic behavior to an actor. In the case of false information having been provided by someone, if the facts provided are merely challenged, the function of the comment is to challenge, but if the false information provided is also stated to be dangerous to someone or against social norms, this can also justify the accusation label.

###Statement

Statements provide information or an opinion, either without someone asking for it or as a reply to someone asking for information. This class includes regular statements, announcements, evaluations and answers to questions:

(Regular) statements assert a fact or a claim; provide information or opinion. They do not set a high expectation for a response (Stivers & Rossano, 2010). They can be “descriptive, narrative, or personal” statements or “other-directed opinion statements” (Stolcke et al., 2000). Opinion statements often include such hedges as I think, I believe, it seems, and I mean. Also, these should not be merely based on a comment containing a piece of (novel) information, but on what the main job of the comment is – stating or asserting. Examples:
“Well, we have a cat.”
“He’s probably, oh, a good two years old.” (Stolcke et al., 2000)
“I believe the earth is warming. I believe this is driven primarily through human-caused CO2 emissions. I disagree that the warming will be catastrophically bad, or even bad at all. I believe a warmer world will be superior in habitability for humans. Sure, there will be some losers, as change always brings winners and losers, but there will be more winners than losers. A warmer world is a better world. The ideal temperature for human habitability is probably higher than the peak that will be reached from "global warming"”. → statement because the general main focus is on stating information. It also involves some level of challenge.

Announcements that e.g. report a general rule or information are seen here as similar to statements. They usually announce some new general information, e.g. piece of news in a forum discussion group:
“Breaking news: England just left the EU!”
Or they report or announce a general rule:
“From this day on trolling will be completely banned from this discussion group.”
“This group uses bots as moderators, so if you misbehave your comments will be deleted by our moderator bot.”

Answers to questions like yes-answers include yes, yeah, yep, uh-huh, and other variations of yes, when they are acting as an answer to a yes-no-question or declarative question. Answers also include no-answers. Important characteristic of an answer is that it often contains novel information that has been requested by someone else in the discussion. (Stolcke et al., 2000). Here answers to questions are treated as part of the statement category as turns in asynchronous conversations rarely involve mere short yes or no answers, but tend to co-emerge with longer statements or expressions of opinion, for instance. Examples:
“My name is Hannah.”
“Yes, I’m Finnish. But I also have many foreign friends and I have lived for two years in Russia.”
Also, many answers in our data emerge in the same form as regular statements, and they cannot be clearly separated from each other as text examples besides judging from their position in the discussion. However, as we did not want the sole deciding factor for the label to be sequence position, we decided to treat answers here as part of the statement category. For example:
A: Would someone at least know how long it has been in Russian possession
B: Written history in Crimea begins in 800 BC. It was first ruled by the Greeks, then by the Byzantines, the Genoese, the Ottomans and the Tatars. In the history of Crimea, the Russians have ruled the peninsula for 172 years, only approx. 6% of the known time.

Evaluations (sometimes called assessments) are utterances that are positively or negatively valenced through use of specific lexically assessing terms (e.g. adjectives such as difficult, awful). We include here in the statement category only evaluations that are negative or neutral in valence, e.g. the use of adjectives (“This is a curious issue.”, “this is a difficult problem to solve”). They essentially appear together and were difficult to distinguish reliably and thus achieve high enough inter-annotator agreement. This is why these are included in the same category. In this annotation scheme we will include positively valenced evaluations in a separate category called appreciation. This is because, in our data, neutral and negative evaluations tend to be essentially intertwined with statements of information or opinion, providing more information to back the evaluation. However, appreciations seem to have a different function in our data, seeking mainly to cheer another actor, congratulate, give thanks, or otherwise show positive emotion toward an object or actor, usually without much further statements of information. Cues: adjectives or comparatives (better, nicer, harder) or other assessment words (superlatives like “This model is the best model.”). For example:
“I think it would be kind of stressful.”
“That’s horrible, another virus. This year is just the worst year in the world.”
“War crimes are disgraceful, not even ‘following orders’ is an excuse because you have a choice, you always have a choice, I’d die to protect civilians, even of the enemy”

###Appreciation

Appreciation category includes various forms of positive evaluative reactions, evaluations and thanking (Cheng, 2010), which can invite a response but do not strongly require it. Basically these are evaluations, but we want to specifically include a category that distinguishes positive evaluations from other types of evaluations. This is because, as mentioned, appreciations had a specific function (differing from negative or neutral evaluations), seeking to cheer another actor, congratulate, give thanks, or otherwise show positive emotion toward an object or actor, usually without much further statements of information. Examples:
“That’s great!”
“I think this was a great article.”
“Thanks that’s a really great thing you posted.”

###Acceptance

Acceptance marks the degree to which a speaker accepts some previous proposal or invitation (e.g. to a party), plan, opinion, or statement. These very often include “yes” or “yeah”, so they look a lot like answers (to questions), but where answers follow questions, acceptances often follow statements (especially opinions), requests or proposals, so distinguishing these can be important for the discourse (Stolcke et al., 2000). 
“yeah it does, they all do”
“yes, I’d love to come. I’ll swing by at 8pm.” 
“Saturday sounds fine.” 

Admissions are included in the same category, acceptance. Acceptances being more central to our data, and thus more descriptive of the merged category, we decided to name this category after them. An admission is to admit e.g. that an accusation made by another actor is true and the accused agrees they have done what they have been accused of. E.g. 
“Yes, you’re right, I did call Helen an idiot. And I meant it.”
“Yes I am trolling.”

###Denial

Denial includes both denials and rejections in one category. They are somewhat less common than other actions like challenges or statements, and have quite similar functions, which is why they were merged into one category. Denial is also somewhat more prevalent of the two in our data (in response to challenges especially), which is why the category is named after it.

Rejection is the negatively positioned counterpart to acceptance – rejections mark the degree to which a speaker does not accept or rejects (or resists) some previous proposal or invitation (e.g. to a party), plan, opinion, or statement. Examples:
“I don’t think so. The article wasn’t bad, it covered all relevant points.”
“No, Friday I’m booked all day.”

Denial is the negatively positioned counterpart to admission. Denials and admissions are essentially related to accusations or challenges, as they are the most natural responses to these action types. For instance, a person who is accused of some wrong-doing is expected to deny or contest the accusation (Pomerantz, 1978; Atkinson & Drew, 1979), admit the wrong they have done, explain themselves (Dersley & Wootton, 2000) or perhaps apologize. Denials essentially contest the accusation (or a challenge). Examples:
“No I’m not trolling.”
“You’re wrong, I did not say she is stupid, I did not mean such a thing!”
